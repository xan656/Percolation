# Percolation
Bernoulli percolation is a model used to study random networks. It involves assigning a probability to each edge or site in a network, determining whether it's "occupied" or "blocked." As you increase this probability, clusters of connected occupied sites emerge. At a critical probability, a giant cluster spans the entire network, signifying a phase transition. This model is valuable for understanding phase transitions and real-world phenomena like disease spread, fluid flow, and network connectivity. Researchers use various techniques, including simulations and mathematical tools, to analyze Bernoulli percolation and its critical behavior.
